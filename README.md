# Deep-Learning CPSC - 8430 
Project Repo for the course Deep Learning taught by Dr. Feng Luo.
There are 3 homework assignments that will be worked on throughout the semester. It covers a wide array of Deep Learning concepts. 

All the files in the repository are .ipynb files that contain python code snippets and results of executing the code in a sequential manner.

## Contents
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/nik1097/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Homework%201) contains python code that demonstrate some of the fundamental concepts in Deep Learning.
- [Homework 2](https://github.com/nik1097/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Homework%202) contains python code that demonstrate video captioning using Recurrent Neural Networks.
